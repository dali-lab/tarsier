# tarsier

# Architecture
The project is developed using [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) with models created in Maya.
There are two main scenes: indoor "museum" scene and the outdoor forest scenes.
Any environment the tarsier/player is in can have a Human toggle and a Tarsier toggle. The "toggle" capacity should be the same for any environment the player is in.

* Indoor Museum Scene: the indoor scene consists of a generic room environment with several stations that highlight the biological features of the tariers.
* Forest Scene: The forest consists of an "infinite" environment where in tarier mode the player can be in the trees and engage in tarsier actions:

We plan to use the Steam VR plugin (assets that provide easy development in VR).
